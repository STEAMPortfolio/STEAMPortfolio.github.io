    1.   What is the difference between "active" and "passive" screen time?<br/>

2.   What type of screen time do you engage in more? <br/>

3.   What screen activities do you value? Why?<br/>

4.   What do you want to cut out? Why?
</p>

<p style="font-size: 21px; text-align: left;">

1.   The difference between active and passive screen time is basically the difference between you actually doing an activity (active) and someone else doing something similar while you watch them (passive). An example mentioned in the video was creating your own video versus watching someone else’s video.<br/><br/>

2.   I probably engage in more passive screen time because I listen to lots of music by the Netherlands Bach Society and watch people play old Baroque Instruments. I also watch people on Flipgrid. Zoom also takes up time, and that can be both passive or active at times.<br/><br/>
    
3.   I value watching videos because a lot can be learnt from watching them. For example, you can learn about a vast variety of subjects including Math, Science, and even English. I also use videos of different pieces of music to help shape my interpretation of a piece to a certain style that is fitting for the period it comes from. I also value certain office productivity suites, such as Microsoft Office 365, Google G Suite, and LibreOffice.<br/><br/>
    
4.   I might want to cut out certain meaningless games that I play on the internet, like Snake. I also would like to cut out certain TV shows like American Ninja Warrior, which are pretty useless. I also want to refrain from watching certain biased sources such as CNN, FOX News, and The Epoch Times so my head is not clouded with misinformation.</p>

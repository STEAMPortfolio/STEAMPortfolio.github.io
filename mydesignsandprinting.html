1. You use place by clicking on a shape on the right bar and then click on the workplane to drop the shape. Place is useful because you can put some material on the workplane.<br/><br/>

2. You use View by right-clicking on the mouse then moving the angle of your view of the workplane. View is useful because it lets you see a different angle of the project. I find it much easier to rotate things a certain way depending on what view I have.<br/><br/>

3. Move is utilized by clicking and dragging a shape. Move is useful because you can use it to position blocks next to each other.<br/><br/>
	
4. Rotate is used by clicking and rotating one of the double curving arrow buttons. Rotate lets you change the angle of a block. This is useful for making something with angles, like a pyramid.<br/><br/>
	
5. To use size, you click on one of the white squares seen when a shape is selected and drag those squares to the right dimensions. The Size tool allows you to make something bigger and adjust its dimensions. So, you can use it to create a long cylinder or a short cylinder.<br/><br/>
	
6. The Group tool is used by selecting multiple shapes then clicking Ctrl-G. It is useful for combining shapes so that Tinkercad thinks of them as one object.<br/><br/>
	
7. You use the align tool by selecting multiple objects and clicking the align tool then aligning the shapes to how you want them to be. The align tool can be used to put different objects in a line. This is useful if many are scattered. Though, I had to do it manually because I couldn’t select multiple things.

<p style="font-size: 21px; text-align: left;">
<strong>How a Makerbot 3D Printer Works</strong><br/><br/>

The Makerbot 3D printer works like most other 3D Printers. First, you take your 3D model and convert it into something that the printer understands using Makerbot software. Then, it melts the PLA filament, puts it through the extruder and out the nozzle. The Makerbot prints in layers on top of the build plate, which the printer perceives as many points on the x-axis and y-axis, and the printer perceives printing upward as printing points on the z-axis.<br/><br/>
	
<strong>About PLA Filament</strong><br/><br/>

PLA is polylactic acid. PLA is made from plant starches, such as potatoes, corn, or soy. It smells like syrup when printing. It breaks down in a landfill, and though it is compostable, it is not biodegradable, and it will not decompose any faster than conventional plastic.<br/>
<a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2019/04/15/bioplastics-bad-environment-damage-arthur-huang/">(Arthur Huang - Bioplastics [are just as bad] for the planet than fossil-fuel plastics)</a><br/><br/>

<strong>How to Load and Unload the Filament</strong><br/><br/>

First, go to the Makerbot menu settings and unload the filament. The machine will heat the extruder to melt the end of the filament and release it when it hits the temperature 215° C. Remove the filament from the extruder when it is safe to do so (when it is 215° C). Now, open the spool compartment and take out the spool of filament. To load the filament, first, open the spool compartment and insert the spool. Insert  the end of the filament into the extruder. Go to the menu and select “load filament.”
